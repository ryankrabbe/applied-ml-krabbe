# Titanic Data Exploration

## Overview
In this project, I will use the Titantic dataset to explore different features that led to survival patterns such as age, sex, gender and fare. I'll manipulate and clean the data so it can be better used for machine learning.

## Dataset 
Titanic Dataset (Predict survival patterns based on features like age, sex, gender and fare)  
- We use the built-in dataset from seaborn:  
   - 'import seaborn as sns'
   - 'titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')'
